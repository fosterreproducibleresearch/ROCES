Whether a given property represents ethnicity or citizenship (nativePlace) can be a difficult decision, but in general, ethnic identities like ""Jewish"" or ""Greek"" take precedence. For example, we consider the Apostle Paul to have Jewish ethnicity, though he was a citizen of Tarsus, because he was raised as a Jew.

"The notion of 'Jewish' as an ethnicity is problematic given the long history of God's chosen people and their many circumstances. Here it refers broadly to the Jewish identity, and is applied to all those from Abraham through Peter and Paul who would designate themselves as Jewish. In particular, no attempt is made to distinguish pre-Mosaic Jewish ethnicity from later forms.
